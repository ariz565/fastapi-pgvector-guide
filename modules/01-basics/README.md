# Module 1: Vector Basics and Fundamentals

Welcome to your first step in learning vector databases! This module covers the fundamental concepts you need to understand before diving into databases and APIs.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By the end of this module, you'll understand:

- What vectors are and how they represent data
- Different similarity metrics and when to use them
- How to perform basic vector operations
- The foundation for all vector database operations

## 📚 Concepts Covered

### 1. What are Vectors?

Vectors are numerical representations of data (text, images, audio) that capture semantic meaning in multi-dimensional space.

### 2. Similarity Metrics

- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures angle between vectors (good for text)
- **Euclidean Distance**: Measures direct distance (good for spatial data)
- **Dot Product**: Measures magnitude and direction

### 3. Embeddings

How real-world data gets converted into vectors that machines can understand.

## 🏃‍♂️ Exercises

Run these files in order:

1. `python vector_operations.py` - Basic vector math
2. `python similarity_metrics.py` - Compare different metrics
3. `python simple_search.py` - Build your first similarity search
4. `python text_embeddings.py` - Convert text to vectors

## 💡 Key Takeaways

After this module, you'll see vectors everywhere:

- Search engines use vectors for relevance
- Recommendation systems use vectors for similarity
- AI models work entirely in vector space
