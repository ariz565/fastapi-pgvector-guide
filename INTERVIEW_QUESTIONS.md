## Vector Database Fundamentals

### Beginner Level

**Q1: What is a vector database and how does it differ from traditional databases?**

- **Answer**: A vector database stores and queries high-dimensional vectors (numerical arrays) representing data like text, images, or audio. Unlike traditional databases that use exact matches or range queries, vector databases perform similarity searches using mathematical distance calculations.

**Q2: What are vector embeddings?**

- **Answer**: Vector embeddings are numerical representations of data (text, images, etc.) in high-dimensional space where semantically similar items are close together. They capture meaning and context in a format machines can process.

**Q3: Name three common use cases for vector databases.**

- **Answer**:
  1. Semantic search (finding similar documents by meaning)
  2. Recommendation systems (finding similar products/content)
  3. Image/video search and retrieval

**Q4: What is the difference between sparse and dense vectors?**

- **Answer**:
  - **Sparse vectors**: Mostly zeros with few non-zero values (e.g., TF-IDF)
  - **Dense vectors**: Most dimensions have non-zero values (e.g., word2vec, BERT embeddings)

### Intermediate Level

**Q5: Explain the concept of vector dimensionality and its impact on performance.**

- **Answer**: Vector dimensionality is the number of features/dimensions in a vector. Higher dimensions can capture more nuanced relationships but increase storage, computation costs, and suffer from the "curse of dimensionality" where distance metrics become less discriminative.

**Q6: What is the curse of dimensionality in vector search?**

- **Answer**: As vector dimensions increase, the relative difference between nearest and farthest neighbors becomes smaller, making similarity search less effective. Distance metrics lose discriminative power in very high-dimensional spaces.

**Q7: Compare different approaches to generate embeddings.**

- **Answer**:
  - **Statistical**: TF-IDF, Count vectors (interpretable but limited semantic understanding)
  - **Neural**: Word2Vec, GloVe (capture semantic relationships)
  - **Transformer-based**: BERT, Sentence-BERT (context-aware, state-of-the-art)

### Advanced Level

**Q8: How would you handle embedding drift in production systems?**

- **Answer**:
  - Monitor embedding quality metrics over time
  - Implement A/B testing for new embedding models
  - Use versioning for embeddings
  - Gradual migration strategies
  - Regular retraining and validation

**Q9: Explain vector quantization and its trade-offs.**

- **Answer**: Vector quantization reduces vector precision (e.g., float32 to int8) to save memory and increase speed. Trade-offs include reduced accuracy, potential loss of fine-grained similarities, but significant performance gains and storage savings.

## Similarity Search & Metrics

### Beginner Level

**Q10: What are the main distance metrics used in vector search?**

- **Answer**:
  1. **Cosine similarity**: Measures angle between vectors (good for text)
  2. **Euclidean distance**: Straight-line distance (sensitive to magnitude)
  3. **Dot product**: Measures alignment and magnitude
  4. **Manhattan distance**: Sum of absolute differences

**Q11: When would you use cosine similarity vs Euclidean distance?**

- **Answer**:
  - **Cosine similarity**: When magnitude doesn't matter (text similarity, document comparison)
  - **Euclidean distance**: When magnitude is important (spatial data, image features)

**Q12: What is k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) search?**

- **Answer**: k-NN finds the k most similar vectors to a query vector based on a distance metric. It's the fundamental operation in vector search.

### Intermediate Level

**Q13: Explain the difference between exact and approximate similarity search.**

- **Answer**:
  - **Exact search**: Guarantees finding the true k nearest neighbors (slow for large datasets)
  - **Approximate search**: Trades accuracy for speed using indexing structures (HNSW, IVF)

**Q14: What is the recall metric in vector search and why is it important?**

- **Answer**: Recall measures the percentage of true nearest neighbors found by an approximate search algorithm. It's crucial for balancing speed vs accuracy in production systems.

**Q15: How do you handle multi-vector search (searching with multiple query vectors)?**

- **Answer**:
  - Average the query vectors
  - Use weighted combinations
  - Perform separate searches and merge results
  - Use advanced aggregation methods

### Advanced Level

**Q16: Describe the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm.**

- **Answer**: HNSW creates a multi-layer graph where each layer contains connections between similar vectors. Search starts at the top layer (sparse, long-range connections) and moves down to denser layers, providing efficient approximate search with good recall.

**Q17: Explain Product Quantization (PQ) and its role in large-scale vector search.**

- **Answer**: PQ divides vectors into subvectors and quantizes each independently using k-means clustering. This dramatically reduces memory usage while maintaining reasonable search quality, essential for billion-scale vector search.

## Text Embeddings & NLP

### Beginner Level

**Q18: What is TF-IDF and how does it create vector representations?**

- **Answer**: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) weighs words by their frequency in a document vs their rarity across the corpus. It creates sparse vectors where each dimension represents a word's importance.

**Q19: How do word embeddings like Word2Vec capture semantic meaning?**

- **Answer**: Word2Vec learns dense representations by predicting context words (CBOW) or target words from context (Skip-gram). Words used in similar contexts get similar embeddings, capturing semantic relationships.

**Q20: What's the difference between word-level and sentence-level embeddings?**

- **Answer**:
  - **Word-level**: Each word gets a vector (Word2Vec, GloVe)
  - **Sentence-level**: Entire sentences/documents get vectors (Doc2Vec, Sentence-BERT)

### Intermediate Level

**Q21: Explain the attention mechanism in transformer models and its impact on embeddings.**

- **Answer**: Attention allows models to focus on relevant parts of input when generating embeddings. It creates context-aware representations where the same word can have different embeddings based on surrounding context.

**Q22: How do you handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words in embeddings?**

- **Answer**:
  - Use subword tokenization (BPE, WordPiece)
  - Character-level embeddings
  - FastText (character n-grams)
  - Replace with special [UNK] tokens

**Q23: What are the advantages of Sentence-BERT over averaging BERT embeddings?**

- **Answer**: Sentence-BERT is fine-tuned on sentence pairs using siamese networks, creating embeddings optimized for semantic similarity. Simple BERT averaging loses the semantic structure that BERT captures.

### Advanced Level

**Q24: How would you implement multilingual vector search?**

- **Answer**:
  - Use multilingual embedding models (mBERT, XLM-R)
  - Translate queries to a common language
  - Cross-lingual alignment techniques

  - Few-shot learning with prompts
  - Adapter modules for efficiency
  - Metric learning approaches

## OpenSearch & Elasticsearch

### Beginner Level
