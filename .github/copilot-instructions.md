# Vector Database Learning Project Instructions

This project is designed for learning vector databases, pgvector, FastAPI, and similarity search through hands-on development.

## Key Technologies

- **FastAPI**: Modern Python web framework for building APIs
- **pgvector**: PostgreSQL extension for vector similarity search
- **NumPy/scikit-learn**: Vector operations and similarity calculations
- **Sentence Transformers**: Text embedding generation
- **PostgreSQL**: Database with vector extension

## Project Structure Guidelines

- Follow progressive learning approach from basic to advanced
- Each module builds upon previous concepts
- Include comprehensive examples and documentation
- Focus on practical, real-world applications

## Coding Standards

- Use type hints throughout the codebase
- Follow FastAPI best practices for API design
- Include proper error handling and validation
- Add comprehensive docstrings and comments
- Use async/await patterns where appropriate

## Vector Database Concepts to Emphasize

- Vector embeddings and their generation
- Similarity metrics (cosine, euclidean, dot product)
- Indexing strategies for performance
- Real-world use cases (semantic search, recommendation systems)
