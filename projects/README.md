## 🎯 Learning Path

**Recommended order:**

1. Start with Document Search (applies Module 1-3 concepts)
2. Build Recommendation Engine (introduces ML concepts)
3. Try Image Search (computer vision integration)
4. Advance to Chatbot (LLM integration)
5. Master Code Search (complex indexing strategies)

## 🛠 Common Setup

All projects share these dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
```

Database setup (using Docker):

```bash
docker run --name vector-projects \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=projects123 \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=vector_projects \
  -p 5433:5432 \
  -d ankane/pgvector
```
