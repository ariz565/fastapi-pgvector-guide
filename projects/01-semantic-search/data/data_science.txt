Data Science and Analytics

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that combines statistics, programming, and domain expertise to extract meaningful insights from data. It involves collecting, cleaning, analyzing, and interpreting large datasets to solve complex business problems and make data-driven decisions.

The Data Science Process

1. Problem Definition: Clearly understanding the business question or challenge
2. Data Collection: Gathering relevant data from various sources
3. Data Cleaning: Removing errors, handling missing values, and standardizing formats
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data patterns and relationships
5. Feature Engineering: Creating new variables that improve model performance
6. Model Building: Applying statistical and machine learning techniques
7. Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance and validity
8. Deployment: Implementing models in production environments
9. Monitoring: Tracking model performance and updating as needed
