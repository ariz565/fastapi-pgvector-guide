            Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn 
            and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms 
            to identify patterns in data and make predictions or classifications.
            
            There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning (learning from 
            labeled examples), unsupervised learning (finding patterns in unlabeled data), and 
            reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error with rewards).
            
            Popular machine learning algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, random 
            forests, support vector machines, and neural networks. Deep learning is a subset of 
            machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks.

            Web development involves creating websites and web applications for the internet. 
            It consists of two main areas: frontend development (client-side) and backend 
            development (server-side).
            
            Frontend development focuses on what users see and interact with. It uses HTML for 
            structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. Modern frameworks 
            like React, Vue.js, and Angular help build dynamic user interfaces.
            
            Backend development handles server-side logic, databases, and APIs. Popular backend 
            languages include Python, JavaScript (Node.js), Java, PHP, and Ruby. Databases 
            like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB store application data.

            Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that combines statistics, programming, 
            and domain knowledge to extract insights from data. It involves collecting, cleaning, 
            analyzing, and interpreting large datasets to solve business problems.
            
            The data science process typically follows these steps: problem definition, data 
            collection, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, modeling, evaluation, and 
            deployment. Tools commonly used include Python, R, SQL, Jupyter notebooks, and 
            visualization libraries.
            
            Data scientists work with various types of data including structured data (databases), 
            unstructured data (text, images), and streaming data. Machine learning and statistical 
            modeling are key components of data science projects.
